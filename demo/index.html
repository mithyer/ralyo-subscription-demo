description: This is a demo # Say something about this subscription

songs: /songs.html # Left part of songs' url is as same as this, but with different path's tail point, and url redirection is forbid.
# If index's url was https:://domain/path/index.html, songs' url would be https:://domain/path/songs.html
# For this case, the songs' url is https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mithyer/ralyo-subscription-demo/main/demo/songs.html

version: 1.0 # Change version when you added, removed or replaced songs. If version remains same, new parsing won't process.

# There is another way to make subscription, which is not recommended, here to see: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mithyer/ralyo-subscription-demo/main/demo/index_with_songs.html
