description: This is a demo 

# Change version when you added, removed or replaced songs. If version remains same, new parsing won't process.

version: 1.0 # !!!!


# Left part of songs' url is as same as this, but with different path's tail point, and url redirection is forbid.
# If index's url was https:://domain/path/index, songs' url would be https:://domain/path/songs
# For this case, the songs' url is https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mithyer/ralyo-subscription-demo/main/demo/songs

songs: songs # !!!!


# If line of 'songs' didn't exist, this will be regarded as case below
# There is another way to make subscription, which is not recommended, here to see: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mithyer/ralyo-subscription-demo/main/demo/index_with_songs
